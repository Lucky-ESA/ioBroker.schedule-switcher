## schedule-switcher adapter for ioBroker

This adapter allows the user to switch devices on/off or 100/0 using time schedules.
The schedules can be fully configured by a vis or vis-2 widget.
One schedule switches one or more ioBroker states and consists of one or more triggers that define when and how the state should be switched.
It is possible to configure at which time and on which weekdays the trigger should be triggered. Astro triggers or countdowns can also be created.

## Requirements

-   Node 18
-   JS-Controller >= 6.0.11
-   Admin >= 7.0.23
-   VIS or VIS-2
